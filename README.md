Compiling
---------

Cinnamon requires C++11 or greater, use unique Makefile to compile for many architectures:

    $ make

    Makefile for cross-compile Linux/Windows/OSX/Raspberry

    make cinnamon64-modern-INTEL     > 64-bit optimized for modern Intel cpu
    make cinnamon64-modern-AMD       > 64-bit optimized for modern Amd cpu
    make cinnamon64-modern           > 64-bit with popcnt bsf sse3 support
    make cinnamon64-generic          > Unspecified 64-bit
    make cinnamon64-ARM              > Optimized for ARM cpu

    make cinnamon32-modern           > 32-bit with sse support
    make cinnamon32-generic          > Unspecified 32-bit
    make cinnamon32-ARM              > Optimized for ARM cpu

    g++ is the default compiler, add COMP=yourcompiler to use another compiler
     example: make cinnamon64-modern-INTEL COMP=clang++
